# Subviews

In the exercise you can play with subviews. The skeleton code `subviews.cpp` contains
a single 2D array. Your tasks are following:

1. Create subviews for the boundaries (top,  bottom, left, right), and initialize
the boundaries with the hel pof subviews using a `parallel_for`.
2. Copy the boundary data to the host. For this, you need contiguous buffers on the device (copying data between non-contiguous views is possible only within the same execution space), and their mirror views on the host.
3. Print out the boundary values on the host.
